# Security Notice: Exposed API Keys

## Summary
The Supabase API keys in the `.env.local` file were exposed in the repository. While the `.gitignore` file prevented them from being committed, they were visible in the working directory.

## Immediate Actions Required

1. **Rotate Supabase API Keys**:
   - Go to your Supabase dashboard: https://app.supabase.com/project/cyiacmjrqdrbkxnafikp/settings/api
   - Generate a new "anon" key
   - Reset the "service_role" key

2. **Update Local Configuration**:
   - Replace the placeholder values in `.env.local` with your new keys
   - Restart your development server

3. **Verify Functionality**:
   - Test the database connection at http://localhost:3001/test-db
   - Test the contact form submission

## Security Best Practices

- Never commit sensitive credentials to version control
- Use environment variables for all secrets
- Regularly rotate API keys
- Monitor API usage for unusual activity
- Use the principle of least privilege (use anon key for client-side operations)
